# Assignment-1
assignment submission for Graphics 375

The WebGL application I found was this fluid motion simulator. I chose this because
it is an unique application that is fairly optimized for something simulating thousands
of particles. I have seen this web app as a interactive wallpaper but never as its own
site. I think its an impressive feat to create and a fun application to play with.
